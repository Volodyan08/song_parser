# Song parser

Small song parser for website: https://www.amalgama-lab.com/, which helps you save songs lyrics in .csv file. All you need just start main.py script and input song URL to parse. It`s so easy to use! I plan to develop the ability to enter several URLs at once. (Maybe with input URLs in .csv file)
